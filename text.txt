Late Balasaheb Thackeray laid the foundation stone for the project in 1999. Initially, the construction cost for the project was estimated to be 666 crores. But due to negligence in construction work and multiple petitions from environmentalists, the actual construction cost crossed 1306 crores. Now, apparently, this additional burden is being recovered from the common man’s pocket every day in the form of the toll. Activists suggest a lot of changes were made in the initial plan to benefit the construction lobby that has developed properties nearby the sea link’s DP road in Worli.
